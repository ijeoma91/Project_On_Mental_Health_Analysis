# Project_On_Mental_Health_Analysis


This project is an unsupervised Machine Learning. The Main focus of this project is to understand the hidden patteren in this surcey data using some analytical methods.

### project Case Study

You are working at a technology-oriented company. The Human Resources (HR) department is about to start a pre-emptive program towards mitigation of mental health issues amongst the companyâ€™s staff. HR has contacted you as one of the company's data scientists to support the program with quantitative analyses. You are provided with the results of a survey, which has been conducted amongst technology-oriented employees and which is considered representative for your company as well. The challenge in working with this data set lies in its high dimensionality and complexity so that it is not straightforward to interpret and transfer the results to the structures of your organization. Another challenge in working with this data is missing values and non-standardized textual inputs. HR has asked you to provide a better overview over the data in ways which are more easily interpretable and transferable to improvements at your workplace. The goal is to categorize participants of the survey according to their answers and to provide visualizations supporting the interpretation of these clusters. These visualizations should convey a perspective onto the data set, which is reduced in complexity and dimensionality and yet preserving the main characteristics of the whole available data. You should also provide insight into each individual identified cluster of participants and their main characteristics. Ultimately, this will help to identify potential points of leverage for the planned program, which will be addressed with targeted measures.
Your written documentation and concept for implementation will be evaluated. The accompanying code for your approach to this use case should be downloadable from the web and a link should be provided as part of the use case documentation.
